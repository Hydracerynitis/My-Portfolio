        <p class="mt-3">This research project develop new methods to investigate datasets' risk of training biased models 
            without explicit involvments' of sensitive attribute values, which is rarely explored in Fairness Machine Learning field.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">I propose the new framework called Sensitive SBC to use subspace of dataspace instead of set partition to represent 
            marginalised populations. And I train metalearning models to estime datasets' risk of bias based on their meta-information
            with accuracy comparable with human labelling.</p>
        <p class="mt-3 highlight">Supervised by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katdost/">Katharina Dost</a> and

        <p class="mt-3">Develop a web app that allows users to train their own Machine Learning models by simply uploading their tabular data.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">It uses MERN-stack technologies, with its server running Python subprocess to train Scitkit-Learn supported ML models and use them for predictions.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">I am responsible for building model creation modules that can be invoked freely by the server to fit usersâ€™ different preferences.</p>

    <paragraph imageName="CovidUpload" title="Covid Contact App" subtitle="MSA Web Development Assessment" :imageSize="6">
        <p class="mt-3">This app is made as software development assignment for the 2021 MSA Web Development program</p>
        <p class="mt-3">It is made in the context of Covid-19, where keeping the whereabouts of infected cases and their
            close contact is imperitive for the public health. This app provides a tool for general public to record their
            daily activities online.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">Whenever an user is flagged with infested through self reporting, other users that share the same 
            destinations at the same time with infested individual will be automatically flagged with close contact. These
            users will get notified such change due to a drastic change in the website's color.</p>
        <p class="mt-3 highlight">The app is built with React (Typescript) + Apollo Hook, alongside GraphQL as its backend server.</p>
