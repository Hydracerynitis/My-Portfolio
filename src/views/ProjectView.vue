        <p class="mt-3">This research project develop new methods to investigate datasets' risk of training biased models 
            without explicit involvments' of sensitive attribute values, which is rarely explored in Fairness Machine Learning field.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">I propose the new framework called Sensitive SBC to use subspace of dataspace instead of set partition to represent 
            marginalised populations. And I train metalearning models to estime datasets' risk of bias based on their meta-information
            with accuracy comparable with human labelling.</p>

        <p class="mt-3">Develop a web app that allows users to train their own Machine Learning models by simply uploading their tabular data.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">It uses MERN-stack technologies, with its server running Python subprocess to train Scitkit-Learn supported ML models and use them for predictions.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">I am responsible for building model creation modules that can be invoked freely by the server to fit usersâ€™ different preferences.</p>
