overview_Title: Covid Tracing App
overview_subTitle: Web App Overview
overview_p1: |
  This application is developed to demonstrate my software development skills learned from the 2021 MSA Web 
  Development program, which earns me the "Certificate of Completion on Software Developement Pathway" from
  MSA at the same year.
overview_p2: |
  The web app follows {MVC} design. Its {V} is built with {React} using {Typescript} and its package 
  {MUI} and {StoryBook}. Its {M} is based on {GraphQL} on .NET platform using {HotChocolate}. {Apollo} is 
  used as {C} to perform query and mutation on {M} and send result to its {V}. Beside that, {Jest} is 
  employed during development to automate unit tests.

logic_Title: Usage of Covid Tracing App
logic_subTitle: Application Logic
logic_p1: |
  This web app is built in the context of Covid outspread. During that time, it is important for people to be 
  mindful for their daily whereabouts in order to identify themselves as close contacts of active cases as 
  quickly as possible. In response, the web app provides tools for keeping track of users' travel histories
  and notify them when they become close contacts. Whenever a user is tagged as active case, the application 
  will mark his past locations as points of interests. Users that share points of interest with the active cases 
  will then get notified that they have become close contacts when they check the app.
logic_p2: |
  The key to achieve it is done through the choice of color. At default, the color of UI will remain 
  {normal}. After users become active case, the color of UI and their points
  of interest will switch to {active}. And woudl-be clost contact users will discover
  that the color of their website has changed to {close}, a way for the app to
  notify them.
logic_normal: green
logic_active: red
logic_close: orange

data_Title: How do App Organises Travel Records?
data_subTitle: Database Structure
data_p1: |
  The database consists of three tables that represent three classes that are essential for the application 
  logics: {AppUser}, {Entry} and {Destination}
data_p2: "{AppUser} contains information of users' profiles, their status regarding Covid and their travel history entries."
data_p3: |
  {Entry} represent users' travel histories. It contains users' destination, their arrival time and their exit
  time.
data_p4: |
  {Destination} records the location's address and all {Entry} that reference it. It is identified by the 
  combination of its name and address. Whenever a new {Entry} is created, the {Destination} obejct it 
  references will automatically add the new {Entry} to its record. 
data_p5: |
  The application logic is implemented through propogation. When an {AppUser} is marked as {active}, all their 
  {Entry} will be marked as interested. Such change will then propogate to {Destination} referenced by these
  {Entry}. The database will then look up {Destination}'s record and search all {Entry} that shares the same 
  time intervals with these interested {Entry}. The owner of the search results will then be flagged as {close}.
data_close: close contacts
data_active: active case
