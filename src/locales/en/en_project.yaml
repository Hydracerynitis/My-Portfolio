honor_Title: Detect Unseen Bias with Metalearning
honor_subTitle: Honour Dissertation Research
honor_p1: |
  This research project explore new methods to investigate the risk of training biased models in datasets.
  By not relying on explicit information of sensitive attributes, we are able to bring researches
  in Fairness Machine Learning to other areas not touched by the reserach field.
honor_p2: |
  I propose a new model called Sensitive SBC, which uses several intervals of feature values to identify 
  marginalised groups. Based on it, I train metalearning models to quantify datasets' risk of bias 
  using their meta-feautres, with the accuracy that is on par with traditional methods.

argus_Title: ArgusML - ML Model Creation Webapp
argus_subTitle: 6-member University Group Assignment
argus_p1: |
  ArgusML is a web app that trains Machine Learning models for tech-illiterate users, allowing them to create
  Machine Learning models that are tailored for their demands without typing any codes.
argus_p2: |
  It is developed by our six-member team for a university group assignment. Our team consists of {Team} and myself. 
  I am responsible of the development of machine learning modules, which handles model trainings and model
  inferences, and can be freely invoked by the application backend.
argus_tech: |
  The app is built with MERN stack - MongoDB database, Expres.js backend, React.js frontend
  and Node.js environment.

covid_Title: Covid Tracing App
covid_subTitle: MSA Web Development Assessment
covid_p1: This app is developed for stage II assignment of the 2021 MSA Web Development program during Covid outspread.
covid_p2: |
  During the peak of Covid outspread, it is important for people to be mindful for their daily whereabouts 
  in order to identify themselves as close contacts of active cases as quickly as possible. This app provides
  tool for users to record their daily activities, and it can notice would-be close contacts based on their records.
covid_p3: |
  Whenever an user is flagged to be an active case (either by themselves or other agents), users that had share 
  the same location with the active case will be automatically flagged with close contact. These users can then
  get notified by checking the app (or by receiving messages sent by the app).
covid_tech: |
  The frontend of the app is built with React (Typescript) + Apollo. Its backend is built with GraphQL on .NET platform.
